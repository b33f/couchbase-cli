== SYNOPSIS

_cbworkloadgen_ [--node <host>] [--username <user>] [--password <password>]
                [--bucket <bucket>] [--ssl] [--threads <num>]

== DESCRIPTION

The `cbworkloadgen` tool is useful to test a Couchbase cluster as well as to
generate test data sets. The tool is installed in the following locations:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Operating system | Location

| Linux
| [.path]_/opt/couchbase/bin/_

| Windows
| [.path]_C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\_

| Mac OS X
| [.path]_/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/_
|===

== Options

-n,--node <host>::
  Target node address in the form `ip:port` or `hostname:port` for example
  `-n 127.0.0.1:8091`. If non provided it will default to `127.0.0.1:8091`.

-u,--username <user>::
  Specifies the username of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-p,--password <password>::
  Specifies the password of the user executing the command. If you do not have
  a user account with permission to execute the command then it will fail with
  an unauthorized error.

-b,--bucket <bucket>::
  Specifies the bucket to operate on. If non provided it will use default.

--ssl::
  Use SSL for transferring and reading data.

-t,--threads <num>::
  Number of concurrent threads use to insert or get data. By default it
  will use 1.

-r,--ratio-sets <ratio>::
  The percentage of the workload that are writes; the remainder will be reads.
  By default it is set to 0.95.

-i,--max-items<num>::
  Number of inserted items. The default is 10000.

--prefix <prefix>::
  Prefixed to use for the document keys. The default is `pymc`.

--s,--size <bytes>::
  Minimum value size in bytes, it defaults to to bytes.

--json::
  When specified the program will insert json documents.

--low-compression::
  When specified the generated documents will be difficult to compress.

--loop::
  The process will loop forever until the user interrupts it.

--xattr::
  When specified the inserted documents will have extended attributes.

-v,--verbose::
  Verbose logging; more -Vs provide more verbosity.

-h,--help::
  Shows help message.

== Examples

To generate workload on a given Couchbase Server use:
-----
$ cbworkloadgen -n 10.5.2.45:8091 -b my-bucket -u Administrator -p password
-----
This command will create 10000 binary documents with keys prefixed by `pymc`
in the target bucket. The output of the command would look as follows:
----
[####################] 100.0% (1111110/estimated 1111110 msgs)
bucket: default, msgs transferred...
      :                total |       last |    per sec
byte  :            111111000 |  111111000 |   636622.5
done
----
To generate a data set of one million JSON documents on a cluster use:
----
$ cbworkloadgen -n 10.5.2.45:8091 -b my-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
 -i 1000000 -j -r 1
----
By default the documents generated by the tool are very compressible which
may not be ideal for some case scenarios to change this use the
`--low-compression` flag as follows:
----
$ cbworkloadgen -n 10.5.2.45:8091 -b my-bucket -u Administrator -p password \
 -i 1000000 -j -r 1 --low-compression -s 20480
----
The command above will create documents with bodies of at least 20480 bytes
(20Kb) that are hard to compress.
