.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\

.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
To retrieve a summary of all profiles run:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c 127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  profile \-\-list
  Name     | # Tasks | Services  | Default
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
  _daily   | 3       | all       | True
  custom   | 9       | Data      | False
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
This will show you the name of all the profiles registered with the service as well as
how many tasks the profiles has and what services are included.
.sp
To retrieve more in\-depth information of a singular profile you can use the \f(CR\-\-get\fP
action argument as shown below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c 127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  profile \-\-get \-\-name _daily
Name: _daily
Description: This profile does a backup every hour and merge 6 hours as well as at the end of the week

merge_week           | merge every sunday at 23:40   | Merge from 0 to 7
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To retrieve the information in JSON format add \f(CR\-\-output json\fP before the \f(CRprofile\fP key
word.
.sp
To remove a profile use the action argument \f(CR\-\-remove\fP as shown below. Note that only
profiles that are not being used by an active instance may be removed. To remove a
profile that is being used, all the profiles that use it must be archived first.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c 127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  profile \-\-remove \-\-name _daily
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
To add a profile  use the action argument \f(CR\-\-add\fP as seen below.
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
$ couchbase\-cli backup\-service \-c 127.0.0.1:8091 \-u Administrator \-p password \(rs
  profile \-\-add \-\-name new\-profile \-\-description "Optional description"

.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The \f(CR\-\-description\fP is an optional string of up to 140 characters that can be used to
describe what the profile does. The \f(CR\-\-services\fP flag defines what services should be
backed up by the tasks in the profile, valid services are
\f(CR[data, gsi, cbas, ft, eventing, views]\fP. Finally, the \f(CR\-\-task\fP argument accepts JSON
task objects. The task objects have the following schema:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
{
    "name": "task\-name",
    "task_type": "BACKUP", // it can be either BACKUP or MERGE
    "full_backup": true,   // optional field to make backup tasks full
    "merge_options": {     // optional field to configure what data to merge in merge tasks
        "offset_start": 1, // the offset on which to start merging in days
        "offset_end": 1    // the offset on which to end the merge based from the start in days
    },
    "schedule": {
        "frequency": 5,
        "period": "HOURS",    // period can be [MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS, WEEKS, MONDAY\-SUNDAY]
        "job_type": "BACKUP", // either BACKUP or MERGE
        "time": "22:00"       // Optional time at which to run the tasks
    }
