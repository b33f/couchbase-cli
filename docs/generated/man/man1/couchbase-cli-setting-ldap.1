attribute values in the search result is considered as list of user\(cqs
groups (single entry result is expected): for example: \(aq%D?memberOf?base\(aq.
If the attribute is not present in the query, every returned entry is
considered a group, for example:
\(aqou=groups,dc=example,dc=com??one?(member=%D)\(aq
.RE
.sp
\-\-enable\-nested\-groups <0|1>
.RS 4

.RE
.sp
\-\-nested\-groups\-max\-depth <depth>
.RS 4

.SH "HOST FORMATS"
.sp
When specifying a host for the couchbase\-cli command the following formats are expected:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRcouchbase://<addr>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CR<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\f(CRhttp://<addr>:<port>\fP
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to use the couchbase://<addr> format for standard
installations. The other two formats allow an option to take a port number which
is needed for non\-default installations where the admin port has been set up on
a port other that 8091.
